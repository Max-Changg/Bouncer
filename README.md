# Bouncer

Forget the laptop and start verifying registrations with your camera app.

## Description

"Bouncer" allows the user to quickly verify registrations through automating the sign-up and check-in process. Sign-up is highly customizable through "Bouncer", allowing users to add checks for sign-ups. Connecting a peer-to-peer payment platform  allows us to parse through records to verify payment. Finally, when "at the door", scanning particpants' QR codes will read back whether or not they have registered correctly.
