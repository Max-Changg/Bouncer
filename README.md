# Bouncer

Forget the laptop and start verifying registrations with your camera app.

## Description

"Bouncer" allows the user to quickly verify registrations through automating the sign-up and check-in process. Sign-up is highly customizable through "Bouncer", allowing users to add checks for sign-ups. Connecting a peer-to-peer payment platform  allows us to parse through records to verify payment. Finally, when "at the door", scanning particpants' QR codes will read back whether or not they have registered correctly. 


The point of this app will be:
- Make inviting people easy
    - email invite via creating google form or
    - dedicated website form
- Ensure people pay for the tickets
    - Website handles transactions
    - Send reminders to those who haven't completed transaction?
- Make it easy to scan them in
    - Give QR code to guest
    - Bouncer scans QR code using website
        - This checks the database for their name if they had filled out the form indicating they rsvp'd, verifies payment,
